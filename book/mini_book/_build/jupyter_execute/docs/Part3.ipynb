    "At this point, you’ve learned a number of AI techniques that draw from classical tree search, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. Each is powerful on its own, but each also has limitations. To make a truly strong Go AI, you’ll need to combine everything you’ve learned so far. Integrating all these pieces is a serious engineering feat. This part covers the architecture of AlphaGo, the AI that rocked the Go world—and the AI world! To conclude the book, you’ll learn about the elegantly simple design of AlphaGo Zero, the strongest version of AlphaGo to date."

    "#### 3.1. Representing a game of Go in Python\n",
    "The game of Go is played on a square board. Usually, beginners start playing on a 9 × 9 or 13 × 13 board, and advanced and pro players play on a 19 × 19 board. But in principle, Go can be played on a board of any size. Implementing a square grid for the game is fairly simple, but you’ll need to take care of a lot of intricacies down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "You represent a Go game in Python by building a module we’ll call dlgo step-by-step. Throughout the chapter, you’ll be asked to create files and implement classes and functions that will eventually lead to your first bot. All the code from this and later chapters can be found on GitHub at http://mng.bz/gYPe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you should definitely clone this repository for reference, we strongly encourage you to follow along by creating the files from scratch to see how the library builds up piece by piece. The master branch of our GitHub repository contains all the code used in this book (and more). From this chapter on, there’s additionally a specific Git branch for each chapter that has only the code you need for the given chapter. For instance, the code for this chapter can be found in branch chapter_3. The next chapters follow the same naming convention. Note that we’ve included extensive tests for most of the code found here and in later chapters in the GitHub repository.\n",

    "- Track the progress of a game you’re playing against a human opponent.\n",
    "- Track the progress of a game between two bots. This might seem to be exactly the same as the preceding point, but as it turns out, a few subtle differences exist. Most notably, naive bots have a hard time recognizing when the game is over. Playing two simple bots against each other is an important technique used in later chapters, so it’s worth calling out here.\n",
    "- Compare many prospective sequences from the same board position.\n",
    "- Import game records and generate training data from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a new folder, dlgo, and place an empty \\__init__.py file into it to initiate it as a Python module. Also, create two additional files called gotypes.py and goboard_slow.py in which you’ll put all board- and game-play functionality. Your folder structure at this point should look as follows:"

    "\n",
    "##### 3.1.1. Implementing the Go board\n",
    "\n",
    "Before turning to `GameState`, let’s first implement the Board class. Your first idea might be to create a 19 × 19 array tracking the state of each point in the board, and that’s a good starting point. Now, think about the algorithm for checking when you need to remove stones from the board. Recall that the number of liberties of a single stone is defined by the number of empty points in its direct neighborhood. If all four neighboring points are occupied by an enemy stone, the stone has no liberties left and is captured. For larger groups of connected stones, the situation is more difficult to check. For instance, after placing a black stone, you have to check all neighboring white stones to see whether black captured any stones that you have to remove. Specifically, you have to check the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You see whether any neighbors have any liberties left.\n",
    "2. You check whether any of the neighbors’ neighbors have any liberties left.\n",
    "3. You examine the neighbors’ neighbors’ neighbors, and so forth.\n",
    "This procedure could require hundreds of steps to finish. Imagine a long chain snaking through the opponent’s territory on a board with 200 moves played already. To speed this up, you can explicitly track all directly connected stones as a unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.1.2. Tracking connected groups of stones in Go: strings\n",
    "You saw in the preceding section that viewing stones in isolation can lead to an increased computational complexity. Instead, you’ll keep track of groups of connected stones of the same color `and their liberties` at the same time. Doing so is much more efficient when implementing game logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "You call a group of connected stones of the same color a `string of stones`, or simply a string, as shown in figure 3.1. You can build this structure efficiently with the Python `set` type as in the following `GoString` implementation, which you also put into goboard_slow.py."
